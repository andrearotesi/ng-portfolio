# Andrea Rotesi's Portflio Website
Welcome to my portfolio's GitHub Repository!
My code is publicly available, if you happen to be curious on how I did things.


# Tech stack
Angular 15.1.6
> I used Angular as it's the framework I'm most comfortable with. I made sure to implement lazy loading and other useful optimizazion practices.

Styling
> I went with pure SCSS - everything is done without the help of libraries, because why not! It's more fun this way.


# Layout
The entire webapp is made with mobile users in mind. Every page is carefully optimized and some features are even mobile-exclusive, such as the navigation menu. Once again, everything is done by hand.
